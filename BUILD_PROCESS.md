## Week 1 – Problem Framing and Direction Setting

### 1. Initial Interpretation of the Problem

When I first read "Decision Companion System," I interpreted it as a conversational assistant that helps users make decisions — essentially a chatbot powered by ChatGPT.

My initial instinct was:

> Build a UI → Send user prompt → Let LLM reason → Return recommendation.

However, after carefully re-reading the email, two constraints stood out:

- The system must not rely entirely on an AI model.
- The logic must be explainable and not a black box.

This immediately invalidated my initial chatbot-based approach.

I realized that a pure LLM-based system would:
- Hide reasoning inside the model
- Make outputs non-deterministic
- Fail the explainability requirement

So I decided to rethink the architecture from first principles.

### 2. Exploring Machine Learning-Based Approaches

My next thought was to use classical ML algorithms like:
- Decision Trees
- Classification models
- Possibly fuzzy logic systems

**Why I considered this:**
- Decision Trees are explainable.
- ML models are often used in recommendation systems.

After researching further, I identified limitations:
- ML requires labeled training data.
- My problem is not prediction  it is evaluation of user-defined criteria.
- ML introduces unnecessary complexity.
- Training-based systems do not align well with dynamic user inputs.

I concluded that this assignment is more about **decision structuring** than prediction.

Therefore, I rejected ML-based approaches for the initial version.

### 3. Considering Graph-Based Recommendation Systems

While reflecting on recommendation systems like Facebook's friend suggestions, I explored whether:
- Graph theory
- Tree structures
- Similarity networks

could be applied.

However, I identified a mismatch:
- Graph systems focus on similarity between nodes.
- My problem focuses on evaluating alternatives against weighted criteria.

The conceptual models are different:
- Graphs → relationship-driven
- Decision companion → criteria-driven

So I ruled this out as well.

### 4. Discovery of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)

After exploring ML and graph-based approaches, I researched structured decision-making frameworks and discovered Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques.

Some approaches I considered:
- Weighted Scoring Model
- Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
- Fuzzy-based evaluation methods

This aligned much better with the assignment constraints.

**Key Realization:**
> The core problem is not prediction. It is structured comparison of multiple options against user-defined weighted criteria.

#### Why I Selected Weighted Scoring

I chose a **Weighted Scoring Model** for the initial implementation because it is:
- Deterministic
- Transparent
- Easy to explain
- User-adjustable
- Mathematically simple yet effective

**The scoring formula used:**

$$Score(O_i) = \sum (W_j \times N_{ij})$$

Where:
- $W_j$ = Weight assigned to criterion $j$
- $N_{ij}$ = Normalized value of option $i$ under criterion $j$

Normalization ensures all criteria are comparable, especially when mixing:
- **Cost criteria** (lower is better, e.g., price)
- **Benefit criteria** (higher is better, e.g., performance)

**For cost criteria:**
$$N = \frac{Max - Value}{Max - Min}$$

**For benefit criteria:**
$$N = \frac{Value - Min}{Max - Min}$$

This ensures:
- Scores are comparable
- The ranking is mathematically consistent
- Every result can be traced and explained

#### Why I Did Not Choose AHP (For Now)

Although AHP provides deeper mathematical rigor:
- It requires pairwise comparisons
- Increases UI complexity
- Adds cognitive load to users
- Slows development timeline

Given the assignment emphasis on clarity and explainability, I made a conscious trade-off:

> **Simplicity + Transparency > Overengineering**

This decision balances technical correctness with usability and time constraints.

### 5. First Prototype – Generalized Decision Engine

Before committing to a domain, I built a generalized version.

The system:
- Accepts dynamic criteria
- Allows users to assign priority weights
- Accepts multiple options
- Computes weighted score
- Produces ranked output

**Purpose of this prototype:**
- Understand normalization challenges
- Validate weight handling
- Test ranking stability
- Identify edge cases

This helped me see issues like:
- What if all weights are zero?
- What if two options tie?
- How to normalize cost vs benefit criteria?

This prototype clarified the core architecture.

#### Rough Architecture I Created

I sketched a basic architecture to visualize the data flow:



The flow is:
1. **User (Browser)** → Inputs options, criteria, weights
2. **Next.js Frontend** → Forms, sliders, UI components
3. **State Management** → Stores and validates data
4. **Decision Engine** → Normalization, scoring, ranking
5. **Explanation Generator** → Score breakdown, reasoning
6. **Ranked Output** → Final results with explanations

### 6. Generalized vs Domain-Specific Confusion

After building the generalized version, I faced an architectural decision:

> Should the system remain generic?
> Or should it focus on a specific domain?

I evaluated both approaches:

**Generalized System**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Flexible | Harder to justify weight logic |
| Broad applicability | Weaker explanation quality |
| | Less domain intelligence |

**Domain-Specific System**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Clear parameter interpretation | Limited to one domain |
| Stronger explanation | |
| More realistic evaluation | |
| Better demonstration of practical reasoning | |

I concluded:
> A focused domain allows better reasoning about parameter importance and trade-offs.

This aligns better with the assignment's emphasis on explainability and practical reasoning.

### 7. Other Crucial Applications I Noted

While researching, I documented other unique applications where decision companion systems are valuable:

| Application | Use Case | Applicability |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Laptop/Phone Selection | Compare devices by specs, price, features | High - clear quantifiable criteria |
| University Selection | Ranking, fees, location, courses, placement | High - multi-criteria with trade-offs |
| Travel Destination | Budget, weather, activities, distance | Medium - subjective preferences |

#### Why I Chose Laptop Recommendation

For the initial phase, I chose:

**Laptop Recommendation under budget and usage constraints.**

Why:
- Clear measurable criteria (price, performance, battery, weight)
- Natural trade-offs
- Real-world relevance
- Easily testable logic
- Relatable to most users

This allowed me to:
- Implement cost vs benefit normalization
- Demonstrate weighted trade-offs
- Provide concrete explanations
- Show dynamic ranking when weights change

The other applications can be added as future extensions using the same generalized engine.

This marks the end of Week 1 direction setting.
